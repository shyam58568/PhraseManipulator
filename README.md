Project Overview

Title: Phrase Manipulator

Description: The Phrase Manipulator is a web application that allows users to manipulate and analyze words, phrases, or sentences entered into a text box. Its purpose is to provide tools for users to perform various operations on the input text. The target audience for the Phrase Manipulator includes students, educators, and anyone interested in linguistics or text manipulation.

Roles and Responsibilities

My role in this project was the developer. The project scope and resources was given by my professor and using that information I was able to develop all the code for this project. My specific responsibilities for this project was ensuring there were no code errors but also on .

Tools and Technologies

The three main languages used for this project were HTML, for the interface that the user interacts with, CSS, the stylization of the HTML webpage, and JavaScript, the code that allows a phrase to be entered and calculate its vowels or consonants. The software used for this project was entirely VS Code and no frameworks or libraries were used for this project.

Project Details

Project Duration: This project was given on 1 week to complete and completed on 12/02/2020.

Team Size: 1 person (Me!) was involved in this project.

My contribution: Similar to previous projects, I referenced w3schools HTML, CSS, and JavaScript references to get a good starting point on creating the code. After I knew what methods I would need, I created the HTML and CSS code first as that was mainly interface oriented. Once I had a good interface ready, I coded the JavaScript code. I first created psuedocode for the JavaScript that descibed how the obtained phrase would be counted for the number of vowels and consonants. Then I coded three seperate functions, one for counting the number of vowels, one for counting the number of consonants, and one for reversing the inputted phrase.

Key Features

Some key features of this project include:

- Users can enter a word, phrase, or sentence into the text box provided.
- There are several buttons available for users to perform different operations on the input text such as Counting Vowels, Counting Consonants, and Reversing the Text
- A button to clear the inputted text
- An output box to show the results

This project provided a good introduction into utilizing case and switch statements and showing the different ways that I could write the same function of code to do a similar thing.
